## Feature 1: Decision Analysis Tab (Phase 8a)

### Access
Click **"🧠 Decision Analysis"** button in the sidebar

### Sub-Tab 1: 🔍 Analyze Ticket
**Purpose**: Trigger AI-powered decision extraction for a specific Jira ticket

**UI Components**:
- Text input for Jira ticket key (e.g., `PROJ-123`)
- "🚀 Analyze" button
- Full decision display with structured sections

**API Call**:
```python
POST /decisions/analyze/{ticket_key}
```

**What It Does**:
1. Fetches ticket from Jira data
2. Retrieves related commits, PRs, and docs
3. Uses AI to extract decision rationale
4. Stores analysis in PostgreSQL
5. Displays structured decision breakdown

**Display Sections**:
- **Problem Statement** - The "why" behind the ticket
- **Alternatives Considered** - Options that were evaluated
- **Chosen Approach** - What was actually implemented
- **Rationale** - Reasoning for the chosen approach
- **Constraints** - Technical or business limitations
- **Risks** - Identified risks
- **Tradeoffs** - Compromises made
- **Implementation** - Commits, PRs, and docs
- **Stakeholders** - People involved
- **Confidence Score** - AI's confidence in the analysis (0-100%)

### Sub-Tab 2: 🔎 Search Decisions
**Purpose**: Natural language search across all analyzed decisions

**UI Components**:
- Text input for search query (e.g., "authentication refactoring")
- Number input for result limit (5-50)
- Expandable search results with preview
- "📖 View Full Analysis" button for each result

**API Call**:
```python
GET /decisions/search?query={query}&limit={limit}
```

**Search Features**:
- Full-text search using PostgreSQL `ts_rank`
- Searches across decision summaries, problem statements, and approaches
- Ranked by relevance
- Shows confidence scores and creation dates

**Result Preview**:
- Ticket key
- Problem statement (truncated to 200 chars)
- Chosen approach (truncated to 200 chars)
- Confidence percentage
- Creation date

### Sub-Tab 3: 📚 Browse All
**Purpose**: Browse and filter all decisions for your organization

**UI Components**:
- Filter input for ticket key (optional)
- Limit selector (10-500 decisions)
- Interactive DataFrame table
- Dropdown selector to view full decision

**API Call**:
```python
GET /decisions?limit={limit}
```

**Table Columns**:
- Ticket
- Summary (truncated to 60 chars)
- Confidence %
- Date

**Features**:
- Client-side filtering by ticket key
- Sortable table
- Click to view full decision details

---

## Feature 2: Source Badges (Phase 7)

### Location
Q&A Chat interface - appears below every AI answer

### Visual Design
```
Sources:
📄 Confluence `3`    🎫 Jira `2`    💻 Git `1`    📝 Code `1`
```

### How It Works
1. Counts references in AI answer: `[DOC-1]`, `[TICKET-2]`, `[COMMIT-1]`, `[CODE-1]`
2. Uses regex to extract counts per source type
3. Displays badges only for sources that contributed
4. Stored in session state for conversation history

### Implementation
```python
def extract_source_metadata(response):
    """Extract source counts from API response"""
    metadata = {
        "confluence_count": len(re.findall(r'\[DOC-\d+\]', answer)),
        "jira_count": len(re.findall(r'\[TICKET-\d+\]', answer)),
        "git_count": len(re.findall(r'\[COMMIT-\d+\]', answer)),
        "code_count": len(re.findall(r'\[CODE-\d+\]', answer))
    }
    return metadata
```

---

## Feature 3: Source Filtering (Phase 7)

### Location
Q&A Chat interface - collapsible section below title

### UI Component
```
🎯 Filter Sources (expandable)
Select which sources to include in answers

☑️ 📄 Confluence    ☑️ 🎫 Jira    ☑️ 💻 Git    ☑️ 📝 Code
```

### Behavior
- All sources enabled by default
- Filters apply to **next query** (not retroactive)
- State persists across session
- Sent to backend API as parameters

### API Integration
```python
payload = {
    "question": prompt,
    "include_confluence": st.session_state.filter_confluence,
    "include_jira": st.session_state.filter_jira,
    "include_git": st.session_state.filter_git,
    "include_code": st.session_state.filter_code
}
```

### Use Cases
- **Confluence only**: "Show me what's documented"
- **Jira + Git**: "What tickets have code changes?"
- **Code only**: "Search the codebase"

---

## Feature 4: Relevance Scores (Phase 7)

### Location
- Decision Analysis > Search Results
- Decision Analysis > Browse All
- Individual decision views

### Display Format
```
🎯 Confidence
   85%
```

### How It's Calculated
- Generated by IntentAnalyzer during decision extraction
- Based on:
  - Quality of source data (tickets, commits, docs)
  - AI model's confidence in extracted fields
  - Completeness of decision structure
- Stored as `confidence_score` (0.0 - 1.0) in database
- Displayed as percentage (0-100%)

### Visual Indicators
- **80-100%**: High confidence (green)
- **60-79%**: Medium confidence (yellow)
- **0-59%**: Low confidence (red)

st.session_state.current_decision            # dict - Currently viewed decision
st.session_state.selected_decision_id        # str - Selected decision ID
st.session_state.selected_ticket_browse      # str - Selected ticket in browse tab
```

### Source Filtering
```python
st.session_state.filter_confluence           # bool - Include Confluence

## Error Handling

### Decision Analysis Errors
| Error | Status | UI Message |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Ticket not found | 404 | "❌ Ticket {key} not found" |
| Authentication failure | 401 | "❌ Authentication required" |
| Analysis timeout | Timeout | "⏱️ Analysis timed out. This ticket may have too much context." |
| Generic failure | 500 | "❌ Analysis failed: {error}" |

### Source Filtering
- Silently passes filters to backend
- If all sources disabled, warning not shown (up to user)
- Backend should handle gracefully

## Known Limitations

### Decision Analysis
1. **First-time analysis slow**: Initial analysis can take 60-120 seconds for large tickets with many commits/PRs
2. **No re-analysis indicator**: UI doesn't show if a ticket was already analyzed (will re-analyze)
3. **No pagination**: Browse All loads up to 500 decisions in memory
4. **No export**: Cannot export decisions to PDF/CSV (future enhancement)

### Source Filtering
1. **No retroactive filtering**: Filters don't apply to past messages
2. **No partial filtering**: Can't filter specific Jira projects or specific repos
3. **Backend support required**: Backend `/ask` endpoint must support filter parameters (may need update)

### Source Badges
1. **Counts from regex**: Relies on `[DOC-X]` format - won't work if backend changes format
2. **No relevance ranking**: Doesn't show which source was most relevant
3. **No click-through**: Can't click badge to jump to specific source
