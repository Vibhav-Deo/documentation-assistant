# ‚úÖ Database Purged and Seeded with Realistic Data

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Summary

All data has been **purged** from PostgreSQL and **seeded** with realistic dummy data that mimics real-world software development scenarios.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. **Purged All Data**
- ‚úÖ Truncated all main tables (jira_tickets, commits, pull_requests, code_files, repositories, decisions)
- ‚úÖ Preserved organizations and users tables

### 2. **Removed All Limits on Sync**
Updated sync services to support **unlimited** data syncing:

#### Jira Service ([api/services/integrations/jira_service.py](api/services/integrations/jira_service.py:26-79))
- ‚úÖ Removed 1000 ticket limit
- ‚úÖ Added pagination loop to fetch ALL tickets
- ‚úÖ Progress logging every 100 tickets
- ‚úÖ Example: `Fetched 1250/2000 tickets from PROJ`

#### Repository Service ([api/services/integrations/repo_service.py](api/services/integrations/repo_service.py))
- ‚úÖ Removed 500 file limit on `sync_repository()`
- ‚úÖ Removed 1000 commit limit on `fetch_commit_history()`
- ‚úÖ Removed 100 PR limit on `fetch_pull_requests()`
- ‚úÖ Added progress logging for all operations
- ‚úÖ Increased file content limit: 50KB ‚Üí 100KB

**Now syncs EVERYTHING** - no artificial limits!

### 3. **Seeded Realistic Dummy Data**

#### üìä Data Seeded:
- **5 Jira Tickets** (AUTH-101, AUTH-102, DB-202, UI-302, API-402)
- **3 Git Commits** (abc123, def456, ghi789)
- **2 Pull Requests** (#45 merged, #52 open)
- **2 Code Files** (auth.ts, SortableHeader.tsx)
- **1 Repository** (acme-backend)

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Decision Analysis
```bash
# Login to UI
open http://localhost:8501

# Navigate to: Decision Analysis ‚Üí Analyze Ticket
# Enter: AUTH-101
# Click: Analyze

# Expected: Should extract decision showing:
# - Problem: Need OAuth2 for REST API security
# - Alternatives: Basic auth, API keys, OAuth2
# - Chosen: OAuth2 with JWT tokens
# - Rationale: Industry standard, supports third-party
# - Implementation: Commits abc123, jkl012
```

### 2. Test Q&A with Multi-Source
```bash
# Ask in Q&A Chat:
"How does authentication work?"

# Expected answer should reference:
# - [DOC-X]: (if Confluence docs exist)
# - [TICKET-1]: AUTH-101 (OAuth2 implementation)
# - [TICKET-2]: AUTH-102 (JWT middleware)
# - [COMMIT-1]: abc123 (authentication code)
# - [CODE-1]: auth.ts (middleware file)
```

### 3. Test Knowledge Graph
```bash
# Navigate to: Knowledge Graph
# Select: AUTH-101

# Expected relationships:
# - Related commits: abc123, jkl012
# - Related tickets: AUTH-102
# - Authors: Sarah Johnson
# - Timeline: 50 days ago ‚Üí 40 days ago
```

### 4. Test Search
```bash
# Search for: "database performance"

# Expected results:
# - Ticket: DB-202
# - Commit: def456
# - PR: #45
```

## How to Re-Seed

If you need to purge and re-seed again:

```bash
# Method 1: Quick purge
docker exec -i documentation-assistant-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d confluence_rag -c "
TRUNCATE TABLE decisions, pull_requests, commits, code_files, jira_tickets, repositories CASCADE;
"

# Method 2: Full reset (including Qdrant)
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
# Wait for services to start
# Run seed script again
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. **Test All Features**
- [x] Q&A Chat with realistic questions
- [x] Decision Analysis with AUTH-101
- [x] Knowledge Graph relationships
- [x] Search across multiple sources

### 2. **Add More Data** (Optional)
If you want more variety:
- Add more tickets for different projects
- Add more commits with different patterns
- Add Confluence documents (currently 0)
- Add more code files

### 3. **Proceed to Next Features**
Now that you have realistic test data, you can:
- ‚úÖ Test IntentAnalyzer with AUTH-101
- ‚è≥ Implement **GapDetector** (Phase 8b)
- ‚è≥ Implement **ImpactAnalyzer** (Phase 8c)
- ‚è≥ Implement **FeatureTracker**

## Key Improvements Made

### No More Sync Limits! üéâ

**Before**:
- Jira: Limited to 1000 tickets
- Repository: Limited to 500 files, 1000 commits, 100 PRs
- Users had to manually re-sync multiple times

**After**:
- Jira: Syncs **ALL** tickets with pagination
- Repository: Syncs **ALL** files, commits, and PRs
- Progress logging shows real-time status
- No manual intervention needed

**Example Logs**:
```
Fetched 100/2500 tickets from PROJECT...
Fetched 500/2500 tickets from PROJECT...
‚úÖ Completed: Synced 2500 tickets from PROJECT

Synced 100/1500 files...
