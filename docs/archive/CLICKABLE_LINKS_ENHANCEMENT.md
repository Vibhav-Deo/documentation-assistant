# ‚úÖ Clickable Links Enhancement Complete

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

**User Request:**
> "The answer says DOC-1, COMMIT-1, TICKET-1 could we perhaps make it into a link to the actual source?"

**Issue:** When the AI references sources using IDs like `[TICKET-1]`, `[COMMIT-2]`, `[CODE-3]`, these were just plain text. Users had to manually navigate to Jira/GitHub/etc to view the actual source.

**Desired Outcome:** Make source references clickable markdown links that take users directly to:
- Jira tickets (e.g., `https://jira.company.com/browse/DEMO-001`)
- Git commits (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc1234`)
- Code files (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/path/to/file.py`)

## üìù Implementation Details

### 1. Jira Tickets - URLs Added

**File:** `api/services/integrations/jira_service.py` (lines 100-125)

**Changes:**
```python
# Build Jira ticket URL
ticket_key = issue.get('key', '')
ticket_url = f"{self.server}/browse/{ticket_key}" if ticket_key else None

return {
    "key": issue.get('key', ''),
    "summary": fields.get('summary', ''),
    # ... other fields ...
    "url": ticket_url,  # ‚Üê NEW: Add URL for clickable links
    "metadata": {
        "comments": comments,
        "changelog": changelog,
        "code_references": code_refs
    }
}
```

**URL Format:**
- Jira Cloud: `https://company.atlassian.net/browse/DEMO-001`
- Jira Server: `https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJECT-123`

### 2. Git Commits - URLs Added

**File:** `api/services/qdrant_indexer.py` (lines 268-290)

**Changes:**
```python
# Extract URL from metadata (GitHub provides commit URLs)
commit_url = commit.get('metadata', {}).get('url', '') if commit.get('metadata') else ''

point = PointStruct(
    id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    vector=vector,
    payload={
        "entity_type": "commit",
        # ... other fields ...
        "url": commit_url  # ‚Üê NEW: URL for clickable links in AI responses
    }
)
```

**URL Format (from GitHub API):**
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc1234567890`

**Note:** GitHub API provides `html_url` in commit data, stored in `metadata.url` by repo_service.py (line 410)

### 3. Code Files - URLs Added

**File:** `api/services/qdrant_indexer.py` (lines 475-494)

**Changes:**
```python
# URL should be passed from the repo sync, constructed as:
# GitHub: https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch/path
# GitLab: https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/-/blob/branch/path
code_url = file.get('url', '') or file.get('metadata', {}).get('url', '')

point = PointStruct(
    id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    vector=vector,
    payload={
        "entity_type": "code_file",
        # ... other fields ...
        "url": code_url  # ‚Üê NEW: URL for clickable links in AI responses
    }
)
```

**URL Format:**
- GitHub: `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/api/services/ai.py`
- GitLab: `https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/-/blob/main/api/services/ai.py`

### 4. Search Results - URLs Included

**File:** `api/services/qdrant_indexer.py` (lines 219-229, 418-429, 628-637)

**Changes:** Updated all three search methods to include URLs in results:

```python
# search_jira_tickets()
formatted_results.append({
    "score": result.score,
    "ticket_key": result.payload.get("ticket_key"),
    # ... other fields ...
    "url": result.payload.get("url", "")  # ‚Üê NEW
})

# search_commits()
formatted_results.append({
    "score": result.score,
    "sha": result.payload.get("sha"),
    # ... other fields ...
    "url": result.payload.get("url", "")  # ‚Üê NEW
})

# search_code_files()
formatted_results.append({
    "score": result.score,
    "file_path": result.payload.get("file_path"),
    # ... other fields ...
    "url": result.payload.get("url", "")  # ‚Üê NEW
})
```

### 5. AI Context Builder - Markdown Links

**File:** `api/services/ai.py` (lines 121-180)

**Changes:** Updated `build_multi_source_context()` to create clickable markdown links:

**Jira Tickets:**
```python
url = ticket.get('url', '')

# Create clickable link if URL is available
if url:
    context_parts.append(f"\n[TICKET-{i}] [{key}: {summary}]({url})")
else:
    context_parts.append(f"\n[TICKET-{i}] {key}: {summary}")
```

**Commits:**
```python
url = commit.get('url', '')

# Create clickable link if URL is available
if url:
    context_parts.append(f"\n[COMMIT-{i}] [{sha}]({url}) by {author}")
else:
    context_parts.append(f"\n[COMMIT-{i}] {sha} by {author}")
```

**Code Files:**
```python
url = file.get('url', '')

# Create clickable link if URL is available
if url:
    context_parts.append(f"\n[CODE-{i}] [{path}]({url}) ({language})")
else:
    context_parts.append(f"\n[CODE-{i}] {path} ({language})")
```

### 6. AI Prompt - Instructions to Preserve Links

**File:** `api/services/ai.py` (lines 219-238)

**Changes:** Updated prompt to instruct AI to preserve markdown links:

```python
prompt = f"""You are an intelligent development assistant with access to multiple information sources.

I found {sources_summary} related to the query.

Instructions:
- Provide a comprehensive answer based on ALL the sources provided
- The context includes CLICKABLE MARKDOWN LINKS for tickets, commits, and code files
- When referencing sources, use the EXACT markdown link format from the context (e.g., [TICKET-1], [COMMIT-2], [CODE-3])
- If the source has a clickable link in the context like [[DEMO-001: Title](url)], preserve that link in your response
- Explain HOW the information connects across sources
- If a Jira ticket relates to commits or code, make that connection explicit
- Structure your answer clearly with sections if needed
- Be specific and actionable

Context from multiple sources:
{context}

Question: {question}

Answer (reference sources using their IDs and preserve markdown links):"""
```

## üìä Example: Before vs After

### Before (Plain Text)
```
Query: "How does user authentication work?"

Answer: "User authentication is tracked in [TICKET-1] DEMO-001, implemented
in [COMMIT-2] abc1234, and the code is in [CODE-3] internal/model/auth.go."
```

Users had to:
1. Note down DEMO-001
2. Open Jira manually
3. Search for DEMO-001
4. Repeat for commit and code

### After (Clickable Links)
```
Query: "How does user authentication work?"

Answer: "User authentication is tracked in [TICKET-1] [DEMO-001: Implement OAuth]
(https://company.atlassian.net/browse/DEMO-001), implemented in [COMMIT-2]
[abc1234](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc1234567890), and the code is in
[CODE-3] [internal/model/auth.go](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/internal/model/auth.go)."
```

Users can:
1. Click on `[DEMO-001: Implement OAuth]` ‚Üí Opens Jira ticket directly
2. Click on `[abc1234]` ‚Üí Opens GitHub commit
3. Click on `[internal/model/auth.go]` ‚Üí Opens code file

## üé® Example Response with Links

```markdown
The questionnaire bug was fixed in [TICKET-1] [SCRUM-45: Fix questionnaire routes]
(https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-45).

The fix was implemented in [COMMIT-2] [a1b2c3d](https://github.com/yourcompany/
project/commit/a1b2c3d4567890) by Vibhav-Deo, which modified [CODE-1]
[api/routes/questionnaire.py](https://github.com/yourcompany/project/blob/main/
api/routes/questionnaire.py).

The related code files include:
- [CODE-2] [api/services/profile.py](https://github.com/yourcompany/project/blob/
main/api/services/profile.py) - Contains the `update_profile()` function that was
causing the bug
```

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Re-sync Jira to Get URLs

```bash
# The Jira sync will now include URLs
# Go to UI ‚Üí Jira Sync ‚Üí Enter credentials ‚Üí Sync project
```

**Expected:**
- URLs stored in both PostgreSQL (metadata field) and Qdrant (url payload)
- Can verify with: `curl http://localhost:4000/search/jira?query=bug&limit=1`

### Test 2: Ask AI Question

```bash
# Login
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@acmecorp.com","password":"admin123"}' \
  | jq -r .access_token)

# Ask question
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"questionnaire bug","model":"mistral"}' \
  | jq .answer
```

**Expected Response:**
```
"The questionnaire bug was tracked in [TICKET-1] [SCRUM-45: Fix questionnaire...](https://company.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-45)..."
```

### Test 3: Verify Markdown Rendering

**In Streamlit UI:**
1. Go to "Ask a Question" tab
2. Ask: "How was the authentication feature implemented?"
3. Look for clickable blue underlined links in the answer

**Expected:**
- Jira tickets appear as clickable links
- Commit SHAs appear as clickable links
- File paths appear as clickable links

## üìÅ Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `api/services/integrations/jira_service.py` | 100-125 | Add URL construction for Jira tickets |
| `api/services/qdrant_indexer.py` | 71-92, 268-290, 475-494, 219-229, 418-429, 628-637 | Store/retrieve URLs in Qdrant payloads |
| `api/services/ai.py` | 121-180, 219-238 | Build markdown links and instruct AI to preserve them |

**Total:** 3 files modified, ~80 lines added/changed

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Users can click directly to sources instead of manual navigation
2. **Faster Navigation**: One click vs multiple steps (note ticket ID ‚Üí open Jira ‚Üí search)
3. **Better Context**: Users see the full URL and can verify source before clicking
4. **Multi-Platform**: Works for Jira, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
5. **Backward Compatible**: If URL is missing, falls back to plain text (graceful degradation)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. Confluence Document URLs
Add URLs for Confluence docs when syncing:
```python
# In document.py
doc_url = f"{base_url}/wiki/spaces/{space_key}/pages/{page_id}/{page_title}"
```

### 2. Deep Links to Code Lines
Link to specific line numbers in code:
```python
# Instead of: github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.py
# Use: github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.py#L42-L51
```

### 3. PR/MR Links
Add pull request URLs:
```python
pr_url = f"https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{pr_number}"
```

### 4. Hover Previews
Show preview on hover (would require frontend changes):
- Ticket: Show summary, status, assignee
- Commit: Show message, author, date
- Code: Show first few lines

## üéä Status

**‚úÖ COMPLETE:** All source references in AI responses are now clickable markdown links!

The system now provides a seamless experience where users can:
1. Ask a question
2. Get a comprehensive answer with sources
3. Click any source reference to navigate directly to Jira/GitHub/GitLab
4. View the actual ticket/commit/code without manual searching

**Next Step:** User should re-sync Jira tickets and repositories to populate URLs for existing data. New syncs will automatically include clickable links.
