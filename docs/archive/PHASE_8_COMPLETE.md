# Phase 8: Advanced Intelligence Features - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented all three advanced intelligence services that provide deep insights into your project.

---

## Phase 8a: IntentAnalyzer (Decision Extraction) ✅

### What It Does
Extracts the "WHY" behind technical decisions by analyzing tickets, commits, PRs, and documentation.

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Analyze ticket decisions
- ✅ Extract problem statements
- ✅ Identify alternatives considered
- ✅ Capture chosen approach and rationale
- ✅ Track constraints, risks, and tradeoffs
- ✅ Identify stakeholders
- ✅ Store decisions in database for future reference

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Analyze a specific ticket
POST /decisions/analyze/{ticket_key}

# Get specific decision
GET /decisions/{decision_id}

# Get decisions for a ticket
GET /decisions/ticket/{ticket_key}

# Search decisions
GET /decisions/search?query=authentication

# List all decisions
GET /decisions?limit=100
```

### Example Usage
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/decisions/analyze/AUTH-101" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Response Includes:**
- Problem statement
- Alternatives considered
- Chosen approach and rationale
- Constraints and limitations
- Risks and mitigations
- Stakeholders involved
- Implementation commits and PRs
- Confidence score

## Phase 8b: GapDetector (Find Missing Work) ✅

### What It Does
Proactively identifies gaps and inconsistencies across your project to surface problems before they become critical.

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Find orphaned tickets (no commits/PRs)
- ✅ Find undocumented features (commits without tickets)
- ✅ Find missing decision analysis
- ✅ Find stale work (not updated recently)
- ✅ Comprehensive gap analysis with statistics

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Find orphaned tickets
GET /gaps/orphaned-tickets?days=90

# Find undocumented features
GET /gaps/undocumented

# Find tickets needing decision analysis
GET /gaps/missing-decisions

# Find stale work
GET /gaps/stale-work?days=30

# Get all gaps at once
GET /gaps/comprehensive
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Find tickets with no implementation
curl "http://localhost:4000/gaps/orphaned-tickets?days=90" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Response Includes:**
- Total orphaned tickets
- Tickets list with details
- Statistics by status, priority, assignee
- Timeframe analyzed

### Use Cases
1. **Forgotten Work**: Find tickets that were never implemented
2. **Poor Linking**: Identify improperly linked work
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Find features without documentation
4. **Blocked Work**: Discover stale tickets needing attention

## Phase 8c: ImpactAnalyzer (Predict Change Impact) ✅

### What It Does
Predicts the impact of changes before they happen to prevent breaking changes and understand ripple effects.

### Features Implemented
- ✅ File impact analysis (what breaks if we change this?)
- ✅ Ticket impact analysis (scope estimation)
- ✅ Commit impact analysis with risk assessment
- ✅ Reviewer suggestions based on file history
- ✅ Blast radius calculation

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Analyze file impact
POST /impact/file
Body: {"file_path": "src/auth/oauth.ts"}

# Analyze ticket impact
GET /impact/ticket/{ticket_key}

# Analyze commit impact
GET /impact/commit/{sha}

# Suggest reviewers
POST /impact/suggest-reviewers
Body: {"files": ["src/auth/oauth.ts", "src/auth/tokens.ts"]}
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Analyze impact of changing a file
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/impact/file" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_path": "src/auth/oauth.ts"}'
```

**Response Includes:**
- Related tickets
- Commit history for the file
- Top developers who worked on it
- Files frequently changed together
- Suggested reviewers

### Risk Assessment
The ImpactAnalyzer calculates risk scores (0-100) based on:
- Volume of changes (file count, lines changed)
- Type of files (config, source code, tests)
- Test coverage presence
- Historical patterns

**Risk Levels:**
- Low (0-20): Localized changes
- Medium (20-50): Module-level changes
- High (50-75): Cross-module changes
- Critical (75-100): System-wide changes

## Technical Implementation

### Services Created
1. **`api/services/intent_analyzer.py`** (Phase 8a)
   - Decision extraction logic
   - AI-powered analysis
   - Multi-source context building

2. **`api/services/gap_detector.py`** (Phase 8b)
   - Gap detection algorithms
   - Statistical analysis
   - Pattern recognition

3. **`api/services/impact_analyzer.py`** (Phase 8c)
   - Impact prediction
   - Risk calculation
   - Dependency analysis

### Database Tables
- **`decisions`** table stores analyzed decisions
- Existing tables (`jira_tickets`, `commits`, `pull_requests`) used for analysis

### Initialization
All three services are initialized on API startup:
```python
# In api/main.py startup_event()
intent_analyzer = IntentAnalyzer(db_service, ai_service)
gap_detector = GapDetector(db_service)
impact_analyzer = ImpactAnalyzer(db_service)
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Understanding Past Decisions
**Problem**: "Why did we choose OAuth2 over basic auth?"

**Solution**: Use IntentAnalyzer
```bash
# Analyze the AUTH-101 ticket
POST /decisions/analyze/AUTH-101

# Or search decisions
GET /decisions/search?query=authentication
```

**Result**: Get complete decision rationale with alternatives, constraints, and risks

---

### Scenario 2: Finding Forgotten Work
**Problem**: "Are there tickets we started but never finished?"

**Solution**: Use GapDetector
```bash
# Find orphaned tickets
GET /gaps/orphaned-tickets?days=90

# Find stale work
GET /gaps/stale-work?days=30
```

**Result**: List of tickets needing attention

---

### Scenario 3: Planning a Change
**Problem**: "If I change this auth file, what might break?"

**Solution**: Use ImpactAnalyzer
```bash
# Analyze file impact
POST /impact/file
Body: {"file_path": "src/auth/oauth.ts"}
```

**Result**:
- Related tickets that depend on this file
- Other files often changed together
- Developers to involve as reviewers
- Risk assessment

---

### Scenario 4: Code Review Preparation
**Problem**: "Who should review my PR that touches auth and database files?"

**Solution**: Use ImpactAnalyzer
```bash
# Suggest reviewers
POST /impact/suggest-reviewers
Body: {
  "files": [
    "src/auth/oauth.ts",
    "src/db/migrations/add_auth_tables.sql"
  ]
}
```

**Result**: Top 3 reviewers based on commit history
